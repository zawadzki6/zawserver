#### Features
- C89 compatibility
- Simple stupid
- Small size, portable binary
- No external libraries - made using glibc

There are no plans to port zawserver to another system such as Wind*ws, make zawserver interactive or implement methods such as POST.

There are also no plans to implement HTTPS.
